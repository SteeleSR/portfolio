This was my first ever project at iO Academy and was built using just HTML and CSS. 
I based the design on an illustration that a friend of mine did (@jamiemuck) and tried to continue the colour theme and style throughout the rest of the page. 
I'm either going to reuse the design for a different project, or perhaps make it into a portfolio for Jamie and make it more dynamic.
